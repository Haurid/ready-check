# About Ready Set Go!
Ready Set Go! is a system agnostic module for Foundry VTT designed to help GM's and players communicate when they're ready to play. GM's are given the option to initiate ready checks, and players can indicate that they're ready (or not) via a button near the chat input.

# GM Instructions
To initiate a ready check, click on the hourglass button above the chat input. This will reset all player statuses to "Not Ready" and put a pop-up on each player's screen asking them if they're ready. When they click Ready, a green check mark will appear next to their name in the players window.

You can use the Ready Check when you first start up the game, right before combat starts, or when you're taking a quick break so you can see when everyone is back and ready to play!

# Player Instructions
To change your status from "Ready" to "Not Ready" and vice versa, click on the hourglass button above the chat input. This will display a dialog with buttons you can use to set your desired status. When you set your status to "Ready", a green check mark should appear next to your name. When you're set to "Not Ready", a red X will display instead.

You can use this toggle to help your GM see when you have to step away to take a phone call, answer the door, slay the kobolds that have suddenly invaded your office, or when you just need a couple extra minutes to sort through your 9,000 spells to figure out which ones you'd like to prepare today. Pfft, wizards...
